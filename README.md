# Chalets and Caviar - real estate in Aspen

OpenClassrooms Front-End Developer path project: 'Integrate a WordPress theme for a client'

## Introduction
This repo contains the brief and deliverables of this project and a URL to the live Wordpress site.  The site is for an imaginary real estate agency in Aspen, called Chalets and Caviar, that sells and rents out luxury chalets. They are looking for a site that has a clear, uncluttered design that exudes luxury. They also want to be able to update the website themselves (especially by adding/updating/deleting chalets).l

The deliverables are:
* A file that explains the theme I chose (Astra) and why 
* CSS file with changes to the theme 
* A screenshot of the admin accounts I created
* A user manual for the admins, so they can add/update/delete chalets themselves. 

For the full brief, see the brief.md file.

## Technologies and approach
As a default theme I chose Astra, which is lightweight, clean, versatile, has lots of options for customisation and can support a big range of plugins, including the ones I wanted to use. To create the luxurious look of the website, I used a posh set of colours (gold, dark grey, beige). For the clean, uncluttered look I used a clean-looking font (Antic), a grid layout, a light-coloured background, and made use of space between elements.
